CMake Warning at C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/ndk/23.1.7779620/build/cmake/android-legacy.toolchain.cmake:416 (message):
  An old version of CMake is being used that cannot automatically detect
  compiler attributes.  Compiler identification is being bypassed.  Some
  values may be wrong or missing.  Update to CMake 3.19 or newer to use
  CMake's built-in compiler identification.
